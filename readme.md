## Hello :wave:

I'm Alex. A graduate from the Queen's University Commerce program and Manager, Training Strategy @ Bell. 

## Projects

* [NHL game and video recaps](https://github.com/alexkruczkowski/NHL-video-project) : Automated newsletter that sends last night's NHL scores and links to video recaps to a list of subscribers. ETL loads data from the NHL API, an automated email process generates and sends the newsletter, and a custom REST API contains the list of subscribers used in the email.

* [Predicting Rental Rates](https://github.com/alexkruczkowski/Rental-Rates-Analysis) : An analysis of rent prices in the metropolitan U.S. I used time series forecasting to determine the optimal rent duration across several major U.S. cities based on price trends and seasonality. For more information on the findings and analysis you can check out my [Medium article](https://medium.com/@kruczkowski.ak/how-to-predict-rent-prices-f267db4569d0)!

* [US Election Dashboard](https://github.com/alexkruczkowski/USElectionVisual) : An interactice visualization of previous US election results by county. Built by leveraging Python and Plotly's Dash framework. You can see the live map / visualization [hosted here](https://alexk-dash-app.herokuapp.com/). Please be patient! It can be slow to load.
